# Ballmer Agentic Conception - BAC — Agentic AI for Autonomous Network Operations

## Project Overview
Agentic AI system for autonomous ISP network operations with observe→reason→decide→act→learn loop.
An "AI Network Guardian" that continuously monitors a simulated ISP, detects anomalies, reasons about root causes using causal inference, verifies safety of actions mathematically, and learns from outcomes.

## IMPORTANT: Use pgmpy (NOT causalnex) for causal inference — causalnex is incompatible with Python 3.11+.

## Setup
```bash
# Python version: see .python-version (3.11+)
cp .env.example .env          # then set OPENAI_API_KEY
cd src/ui/dashboard && cp .env.example .env  # set VITE_API_URL
```

## Commands

### Backend
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the FastAPI server (starts simulator + agent loop + WebSocket)
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Run the CLI demo (hackathon demo, no UI needed)
python demo.py

# Train RL traffic engineering model on synthetic data
python train_rl_synthetic.py

# Generate evaluation dataset
python -m src.evaluation.generate_dataset

# Run evaluation (precision, recall, F1, MTTD, MTTM)
python -m src.evaluation.evaluate
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd src/ui/dashboard
npm install
npm run dev      # dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # production build
```

### Tests
```bash

```

### Linting / Type-checking

ruff check src/
mypy src/
```

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python 3.11+, FastAPI, WebSockets
- **Agent Framework:** LangGraph (stateful agent orchestration with observe→reason→decide→act→learn graph)
- **LLM:** OpenAI GPT-4o (via OPENAI_API_KEY in .env) — used for reasoning, hypothesis formation, debate agents, and explanations
- **Causal Inference:** pgmpy (NOTEARS/BayesianNetwork), networkx (topology graph)
- **Safety Verification:** z3-solver (formal proof that actions are safe before execution)
- **Anomaly Detection:** scikit-learn IsolationForest, EWMA statistical detector, threshold-based rules
- **Traffic Forecasting:** LSTM (PyTorch) for predicting congestion before it happens, Prophet as fallback
- **Data:** Synthetic ISP telemetry generated with numpy + pandas (labeled anomaly scenarios)
- **Frontend:** React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Recharts + D3.js (force-directed topology graph)
- **Database:** SQLite (audit log, action history), FAISS (RAG vector store)
- **RAG:** LangChain + OpenAI embeddings + FAISS for network runbook retrieval
- **Streaming:** WebSockets for real-time telemetry and agent event streaming to UI

## Key Differentiators (What Makes Us Win)
1. **Causal Counterfactual Digital Twin** — pgmpy + PC/NOTEARS algorithm. Agent reasons causally ("root cause of latency on link X is congestion on upstream link Y triggered by BGP change 12 min ago"). Runs counterfactual simulations before acting ("if I reroute A→B, what happens to C, D, E?").
2. **Formal Safety Verification with Z3** — Every autonomous action is mathematically proven safe against invariants (no link >85% utilization after reroute, rollback path must exist, blast radius caps). "Provable safety guarantees."
3. **Multi-Agent Adversarial Debate** — High-risk decisions trigger a panel: ReliabilityAgent vs PerformanceAgent vs CostSLAAgent, judged by a JudgeAgent. Debate transcript = explainability layer.
4. **LSTM Traffic Forecasting** — Predicts congestion 10-30 minutes ahead so the agent can act proactively, not reactively. Trained on synthetic diurnal traffic patterns.
5. **Graph-Based Reasoning** — Network topology as a graph (NetworkX). Graph analytics for root cause analysis — anomaly propagation scoring across topology neighbors.

## Agent Loop Architecture (LangGraph)
```
observe ──→ reason ──→ decide ──┬──→ verify ──→ act ──→ learn ──→ observe
                                │                              (loop)
                                └──→ debate ──→ verify
                                  (if high risk)
```

## Decision Policy
- confidence < 0.6 → create ticket only (passive)
- confidence 0.6-0.85 AND low blast radius → auto-execute with monitoring
- confidence >= 0.85 AND Z3 verified → auto-execute
- high blast radius OR risk >= 0.7 → require human approval OR trigger debate
- Z3 verification fails → BLOCK action, explain which constraint violated

## Autonomy Boundaries
- **AUTOMATIC:** Rate-limit suspicious flow (<0.5% sessions affected, confidence ≥0.85), adjust TE weights
- **AUTOMATIC_CANARY:** Reroute on single edge router for 10 min, auto-rollback if metrics worsen
- **HUMAN_APPROVAL:** BGP changes, mass route changes, core switch restart, config affecting ≥5% traffic
- **NEVER_AUTOMATE:** Billing systems, PII stores, regulatory routing

## Rollback Policy
All automated changes embed a rollback token. Auto-rollback triggers if key metrics worsen within 10 minutes.

## Conventions
- Type hints on all functions
- Docstrings on all public functions
- Pydantic models for data validation (all data flowing between agents)
- Structured logging with loguru
- All agent decisions logged to immutable audit trail
- OpenAI calls use langchain ChatOpenAI wrapper
